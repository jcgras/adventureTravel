# Adventure Travel - React Native App
{: .no_toc }

Version: 1.0.1
{: .label .label-green }

With **Adventure Travel App** we want to offer more than a set of components and styles. We have carefully created a project where we aim to provide a simple structure for any kind of React Native project, allowing you to adapt, reuse and create react native components easily.

For this project we have been inspired by an Adventure Travel Agency, however, we intend that this project can also be used in a wide range of businesses. If you had a web page for your business, **Adventure Travel** supports you to convert/extend your current websites to mobile app efficiently.
