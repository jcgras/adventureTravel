    "content": "Project Structure . In this session we will describe the structure designed for this project. With this design we intend to offer you a solution adaptable to any kind of management app. With the combination of Redux and Firebase Realtime Database technologies we can generate a synchronized system, which allows the update in real time with all your devices. . . . Application modules Static images | | Redux, one state to rule them all Actions | Reducers | Middlewares | Store | | Components Connecting the components to the store | Search component | | . Application modules . A structure must be simple enough for new team members to quickly get on board and immerse themselves into the project. . React’s ecosystem offers users complete control over everything, without being tied to any particular way of doing things. However, whenever we work on a React project it is necessary to use some kind of consensus to organize the source code. With this in mind, we believe that the ideal React project structure is the one that allows you to move around your code with the least amount of effort. Following this principle, Adventure Travel is made up of a simple project structure that allows you to easily scalate, adapt, reuse and create React Native components. In any case, you are welcome to adjust this structure for your own use case. . To get into context, let’s start analyzing the project from the JavaScript source code located in the /src folder. Remember that React Native uses the JavaScript language to generate from the source code to iOS and Android platforms, both in the /ios and android folders respectively. Inside the /src folder all the modules of the application will be organized. . 📂 src ┣ 📁 common ┣ 📁 components ┣ 📁 images ┣ 📁 redux ┣ 📁 screens ┗ 📦 package.json . Module Description . common | It contains the common elements such as global styles, colors, utils, etc. | . components | Here we place the application components and their related styles. | . images | It contains the static images used in the project such as illustrations, logos, etc. | . navigation | This module contains the components related to navigation. It contains the paths and references to screens, modals and tabs. | . redux | It contains the elements related to Redux, such as: actions, reducers, middlewares and the store configuration. | . screens | It contains the components relating to the application screens and their related styles. | . You have probably noticed that in each of these modules the files index.js and package.json are included. Both files are used to export and define the module with global access within the project. . 📂 src ┣ 📂 common ┃ ┣ Color.js ┃ ┣ Device.js ┃ ┣ Images.js ┃ ┣ RealtimeDatabase.js ┃ ┣ DatabaseSeeder.js ┃ ┣ Styles.js ┃ ┣ Util.js ┃ ┣ index.js ┃ ┗ 📦 package.json ┣ 📁 components ┣ 📁 images ┣ 📁 redux ┣ 📁 screens ┗ 📦 package.json . In the index.js file we must include all the module reference (imports) and then export it to make it visible outside the folder. . /src/common/index.js . import {Styles, FontSize} from &#39;./Styles&#39;; import Color from &#39;./Color&#39;; import Device from &#39;./Device&#39;; import Images from &#39;./Images&#39;; import RealtimeDatabase from &#39;./RealtimeDatabase&#39;; import DatabaseSeeder from &#39;./DatabaseSeeder&#39;; import Util from &#39;./Util&#39;; import GoogleAPIs from &#39;./GoogleAPIs&#39;; export { Styles, Color, FontSize, Device, Images, RealtimeDatabase, DatabaseSeeder, Util, GoogleAPIs, }; . Also using the package.json file we can define the name of the package as global and use it anywhere in the project. . /src/common/package.json . { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;@common&quot; } . Now if you need to import something (like Color) from the common module you can refered it using @common route instead of all the static route. . import { Color } from &quot;@common&quot;; const primaryColor = Color.primary; . Static images . In any mobile application project it is necessary to use static image files (embedded in the app) instead of always downloading them from the Internet. This applies mainly for image files such as illustrations, logos, icons, etc. For this reason we have included a single folder to store all the embedded image files, located in the path: /src/images. We have included also the Images.js file in the @common module to export the reference of all the static images, located in the images folder. . /src/common/Images.js . export default { logoWhite: require(&quot;@images/logos/logoWhite.png&quot;), IllustSettings: require(&quot;@images/illustrations/settings.png&quot;), } . Whenever you need to use a static image just reference Images from the @common module. . import { Images } from &quot;@common&quot;; render() { return ( &lt;View&gt; &lt;Image source={Images.logoWhite} /&gt; &lt;/View&gt; ); } . . Redux, one state to rule them all . Redux handles the entire application data flow within a single container while the previous state persists as well. . As an important part of our architecture, we include Redux for application status management. With Redux we can have one application state as a global state (“Single source of truth”), that includes all application data -like bookings and bookmarks- but also temporary states like search results, search history or popular destinations. . Tree view from React Native Debugger . To use this library (actually Redux is a library) a redux module was created that includes the actions, middlewares, reducers folders and the store.js file. Following the same logic as above, we have also included the package.json file for the module name. . 📂 src ┣ 📁 common ┣ 📁 components ┣ 📁 images ┣ 📂 redux ┃ ┣ 📁 actions ┃ ┣ 📁 middlewares ┃ ┣ 📁 reducers ┃ ┣ 📦 package.json ┃ ┗ store.js ┣ 📁 screens ┗ 📦 package.json . Actions . The whole state of the app is stored in an object tree inside a single store. The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. (Redux Documentation) . Following this principle, the actions folder has been created as a container for the action files of each data object. For example, we have included the bookmarks.js file for all actions that manage bookmarks objects (saved items). Inside this file we can find a set of functions (Action Creators) to manage each action, for example, adding a new bookmark. So actions are the information (Objects) and action creator are functions that return these actions. . /src/redux/actions/bookmarks.js . const addBookmark = bookmark =&gt; { return { type: &quot;ADD_BOOKMARK&quot;, payload: bookmark } } // ....... export { // ....... addBookmark }; . Reducers . Actions only tell what to do, but they don’t tell how to do, so reducers are the pure functions that take the current state and action and return the new state and tell the store how to do. To summarize, the reducers specify how the actions transform the state tree. We have included the reducers folder to group the reducers of each object. . /src/redux/reducers/bookmarks.js . const defaultState = []; function reducer(state = defaultState, {type, payload}) { switch (type) { case &#39;ADD_BOOKMARK&#39;: { return [...state, payload]; } case &#39;DELETE_BOOKMARK&#39;: { return state.filter((b) =&gt; b.id !== payload); } case &#39;CLEAR_BOOKMARKS&#39;: { return defaultState; } default: return state; } } export default reducer; . Middlewares . Basically a middleware is some code you can put between the framework receiving a request, and the framework generating a response. Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. You can usually use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more. - Redux Middleware . In this architecture we have included a middleware to manage the synchronization between remote data (Firebase Realtime Database) and local data (local store). For example, when we call the action ADD_BOOKMARK this middleware will be invoked, the action will be detected and the information will be sent to the remote database. At the same time the action is executed and the local store is updated from the corresponding reducer. . /src/redux/middlewares/firebase.js . import database from &#39;@react-native-firebase/database&#39;; import auth from &#39;@react-native-firebase/auth&#39;; const firebase = (store) =&gt; (next) =&gt; (action) =&gt; { switch (action.type) { case &#39;ADD_BOOKMARK&#39;: next(action); database() .ref(`/bookmarks/${auth().currentUser.uid}/${action.payload.id}`) .set({...action.payload, created: new Date().getTime()}); break; //........ } }; export default firebase; . The above example applies to updating remote data, however when using Firebase Realtime Database, synchronization can occur in reverse. That is, if you update the remote data, either from another device or from another interface such as a website, you must also update the local store. To complete this cycle a startListening function has been added to “listen” all the time for remote Firebase updates and update the local store only if the information does not exist. . /src/common/RealtimeDatabase.js . import database from &#39;@react-native-firebase/database&#39;; import {store} from &#39;@redux/store&#39;; const RealtimeDatabase = (() =&gt; { return { startListening: () =&gt; { const {user} = store.getState(); /* Listening for new bookmark */ database() .ref(`bookmarks/${user.uid}`) .orderByChild(&#39;created&#39;) .on(&#39;child_added&#39;, (snapshot) =&gt; { const newBookmark = snapshot.val(); const {bookmarks} = store.getState(); const exist = bookmarks.some((b) =&gt; b.id === newBookmark.id); // Add only if you are on another device (the bookmark doesn&#39;t exist) if (!exist) { store.dispatch({ type: &#39;ADD_BOOKMARK&#39;, payload: newBookmark, }); } }); //........ })(); export default RealtimeDatabase; . Store . The store is the object which holds the state of the application. We have created the store.js file to include the single store for the entire application, as recommended by the Redux documentation: . It’s important to note that you’ll only have a single store in a Redux application. When you want to split your data handling logic, you’ll use reducer composition instead of many stores. - Redux Documentation . To start using the store instance you just need to import and call createStore. In our case we use multiple reducers, therefore it is necessary to include the combineReducers() function to combine several reducers into one. . /src/redux/store.js . import {createStore, combineReducers, compose, applyMiddleware} from &#39;redux&#39;; import {persistStore, persistReducer} from &#39;redux-persist&#39;; import thunk from &#39;redux-thunk&#39;; import firebase from &#39;./middlewares/firebase&#39;; // ... import searchHistory from &quot;./reducers/searchHistory&quot;; import bookmarks from &quot;./reducers/bookmarks&quot;; import bookings from &quot;./reducers/bookings&quot;; import config from &#39;./reducers/config&#39;; const reducer = combineReducers({ // ... searchHistory, bookmarks, bookings, config, }); . We also use Redux-Persist to save the Redux store when the app is closed, and refer to the middlewares: firebase middleware (described above) and Redux-Thunk middleware to write Action Creators that return a function instead of an action. This last element is the one that allows us to create actions such as addBookmark as functions. . /src/redux/store.js . const persistConfig = { key: &#39;root&#39;, storage: AsyncStorage, whitelist: [ &#39;user&#39;, &#39;explore&#39;, &#39;categories&#39;, &#39;popular&#39;, &#39;searchHistory&#39;, &#39;bookmarks&#39;, &#39;bookings&#39;, &#39;config&#39;, ], blacklist: [], }; const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose; const persistedReducer = persistReducer(persistConfig, reducer); const store = createStore( persistedReducer, composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(thunk, firebase)), ); let persistor = persistStore(store); export {persistor, store}; . Below, we specify how the store is connected to the user interface. . . Components . As you probably know, React bases its architecture on components. That is: each piece of an app is handled as an isolated component (class or Hooks) where its own states, properties, styles and the access to the store are handled. With Adventure Travel you have a variety ready-to-use components to create your own mobile application. Components like ButtonGradient, CardPopular or ImageCollage can be found in the /src/components folder. Similarly we have created a folder to organize the components relating to the screens of the app: /src/screens. In this way we separate more atomic components like ButtonGradient from the more complex ones that compose a screen. . Basically each component extends from React.PureComponent and implements a render() method where the UI is returned in jsx format. . /src/components/ButtonBookmark/index.js . import React from &quot;react&quot;; import PropTypes from &quot;prop-types&quot;; class ButtonBookmark extends React.PureComponent { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { // ... } } ButtonBookmark.propTypes = { experienceId: PropTypes.number } const styles = StyleSheet.create({ content: { alignSelf: &quot;flex-end&quot;, alignItems: &quot;flex-end&quot;, padding: 8 }, icon: { fontSize: 20 } }); . In each component we also include the use of propTypes to declare the properties required by the component and its data type. When props are passed to a component, they are checked against the type definitions configured in the propTypes property. When an invalid value is passed for a prop, a warning is displayed on the console. To learn more about how you can use prop-types and all the available validators, see their documentation. . Likewise, each component includes the reference to the component’s own styles using StyleSheet within the same file. Using the constant styles you can access the styles inside each component. . Connecting the components to the store . To connect the Redux store to the UI (components) we use the connect() function from react-redux. This function provides to the connected component the data it requires from the store, and the functions it can use to send actions to the store. If the component requires the use of an action that handles the state of the application, such as addBookmark, we can import the functions that we had already created in the actions folder. . import React from &quot;react&quot;; import { addBookmark, deleteBookmark } from &quot;@redux/actions/bookmarks&quot;; import { connect } from &quot;react-redux&quot;; . Then we must create the mapStateToProps object to specify the properties we want to use from the global state and the mapDispatchToProps object to link the imported functions that act on the global state. We can then invoke the connect function using these objects as parameters and connect the component (ButtonBookmark in this example) to export it. This way you can access the declared properties to read the global state values and the functions to modify the global state. . /src/components/ButtonBookmark/index.js . import React from &quot;react&quot;; import PropTypes from &quot;prop-types&quot;; import { addBookmark, deleteBookmark } from &quot;@redux/actions/bookmarks&quot;; import { connect } from &quot;react-redux&quot;; class ButtonBookmark extends React.PureComponent { // ... } // ... const mapStateToProps = state =&gt; { return { bookmarks: state.bookmarks, experiences: state.explore.experienceResults.experiences }; }; const mapDispatchToProps = { addBookmark, deleteBookmark }; export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(ButtonBookmark); . Now within the functions of the component it is possible to access as a property to the global state of bookmarks (this.props.bookmarks) or experiences (this.props.experiences). Similarly, the functions this.props.addBookmark and this.props.deleteBookmark can be accessed as properties. . render() { const booked = this.props.bookmarks.some(b =&gt; b.id == this.props.experienceId); return ( &lt;TouchableOpacity style={styles.content} onPress={booked ? this.removeBookmark : this.addBookmark} &gt; &lt;Icon name={booked ? &quot;heart&quot; : &quot;hearto&quot;} color={booked ? Color.heart : Color.background} style={styles.icon} /&gt; &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt; ); } addBookmark = () =&gt; { const experience = this.props.experiences.find(e =&gt; e.id == this.props.experienceId); this.props.addBookmark(experience); } removeBookmark = () =&gt; { this.props.deleteBookmark(this.props.experienceId) } . Search component .

    "title": "Push Notifications",
    "content": "Push Notifications . We have added push notifications to this project, allowing you to send alerts to users using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service. FCM is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost. Notifications can be sent directly from Firebase Console or through third party applications integrated with FCM. If you want to set up push notifications for your project on iOS you need to make some security settings first. But for Android projects you are not required to do anything else and you can start testing by broadcasting push notifications from FCM. . . . Apple Push Notifications service (APNs) configuration Generate a Certificate Request | Generate a certificate from Apple Developer Program | Generate and import a .p8 key | | Broadcasting Push Notifications from FCM | . Apple Push Notifications service (APNs) configuration . As a first requirement you should keep in mind that push notifications for iOS is only possible on physical devices and does not apply to simulators. Therefore, if you want to test push notifications in iOS, you should connect a physical device to your computer and run the app from there. Also you must have a paid Apple Developer Program account to create certificates for push notifications. . Security certificates are required to start push notifications on iOS-based devices. Below we will describe the steps required to obtain and configure development certificates, which although indicated as being for development, it is also possible to use it in production applications. However, it is recommended to use certificates issued by certified authorities for production applications. . Generate a Certificate Request . We must start by generating a certificate request, for that we must open the Keychain Access program, accessible from Finder-&gt;Applications-&gt;Utilities in a MAC environment. From the main menu of Keychain Access, select the menu Certificate Assistant-&gt;Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority… . . In the assistant you must fill out an applicant’s email address, the name and email address of the authority, in this case as it is a development environment you can put any value. Then select save to disk and continue to generate a certificate request file that you should save for the next action. . . Generate a certificate from Apple Developer Program . With the certificate request file, generated previously, you can get a certificate for the push notifications. To do that, you must log in to the Apple Developer Program site using your apple developer account and go to the Account menu and then to Certificates, IDs &amp; Profiles. Select Identifiers from the menu on the left to add/edit your app identifier. . . If your app identifier is not created yet you can click on the plus icon to add your app identifier. In this case you must register an App ID, specify the Bundle ID and check the option for Push Notifications. If your App ID already exists select it and go to Push Notifications and check it. Then select the configure button. . . Then click on the Create Certificate button under the Development SSL Certificate option. . . From the new screen you must upload the Certificate Signing Request file, generated previously. . . Finally click on continue to generate the certificate and download it. Open the downloaded certificate by double-clicking it to import it into Keychain Access and have it installed in your environment. . After the certificate is imported into Keychain Access, open the iOS project from Xcode and select the tab Signing &amp; Capabilities and then the option + Capability. Add the capabilities Push Notifications and Background Modes and check the option Remote notifications. . . Generate and import a .p8 key . To start sending push notifications from the FCM service it is necessary to first generate a .p8 key to sign the messages. To do this you must go back to Certificates, IDs &amp; Profiles from the Apple Developer Program site and select the Keys menu and click on the plus icon to add a new key. Specify a name for the new key, check the APNs option and click continue. . . Download the key once it is generated. Note that you can only download once, so you must store it securely. Similarly copies the value of the Key ID, although you can always access this value from the Keys menu. . This .p8 key must be added to Firebase Cloud Messaging in order to issue push notifications. To do this you must go to the Firebase Console and access to the Project Settings menu. . . Then access to the Cloud Messaging tab and go down to the iOS app configuration option to upload the .p8 file. . . From the upload dialog you must to specify the Key ID related to the key and the Team ID; this last value is available from Membership Details. . Once you successfully upload the key you are ready to broadcast push notifications! . Broadcasting Push Notifications from FCM . Once you have the app configured to send push notifications you can start with a simple test to validate this. Remember that for notifications on iOS devices you must first configure APNs, however it will be possible to receive notifications as modals in any simulator while the app is active. That is, while the app is active you can receive notifications and show them in a dialog or any component you want to design for that. This behavior is defined by the onMessage method included in /src/screens/splashScreen/index.js for handling new messages, while the app is in active mode. If the app is in background or inactive mode the notification will be handled by the system. . To start with a simple test run the React Native project and go to the console to copy the value of the token key generated for your device, printed on the React Native console. . . With this copied value go to the Firebase Console and select the Cloud Messaging menu and then click on the Send your first message button to compose the notification. From the Compose notification screen enter the Notification title and the Notification text, then click on the Send test message button. . . In the new modal enter the token key value, copied previously, and click on Test button to send the notification to your device. . . If you have a physical device connected and the app is not in active mode, you should see the push notification in the message box. . . If you are using a simulator or a connected physical device and the app is in active mode, you should see the notification from an Alert Dialog. . .",

    "title": "Backend configuration",
    "content": "Backend Configuration . As part of the architecture we have added the use of Firebase as a complement for backend operations. Firebase is a Google Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that helps you build, improve and grow your applications. Firebase offers a wide range of features, but for the purposes of this project we will focus on the following services: . Firebase Authentication (For our user authentication service) | Firebase Realtime Database (As realtime database) | Cloud Firestore (As database) | Cloud Messaging (For Push Notifications) | . To start working on the project, it is necessary to first configure a new application from Firebase Console platform. Below we describe all the steps to configure the Firebase based backend. . . . Create a Firebase project Register your app with Firebase (iOS) | Register your app with Firebase (Android) | | Firebase Authentication | Firebase Realtime Database | Cloud Firestore | Cloud Messaging (Push Notifications) | . Create a Firebase project . Before you can add Firebase to your app, you need to create a Firebase project to connect to your iOS or Android app. Follow these steps or consult the Firebase documentation to create a new project. . Sign into Firebase using a Google account. | In the Firebase console, click Add project, then select or enter your Project name | Click Continue. | Click Create project | Firebase automatically provisions resources for your Firebase project. When the process completes, you’ll be taken to the overview page for your Firebase project in the Firebase console. . Register your app with Firebase (iOS) . If you are working with the iOS platform it’s necesary to register a new iOS App in Firebase. From the Project Overview, use the Add app option and then select the iOS icon to open the registration wizard. . . In the registration wizard you must fill out the iOS bundle ID of the application (located in the General tab in Xcode), for this project would be: dev.svalbard.app. Later, for your particular project, you must use the Bundle Identifier you created your project with, but to test the app we will use this value first. . . To finish download the generated configuration file google-service.plist and include it into the project from Xcode. This file contains all the information to link our app with the created project, allowing you to access any of the Firebase services. . . Skip the next steps (we already have done this configuration in the app) and continues until the end of the wizard to finish with the app registration. . Register your app with Firebase (Android) . If you are working with the Android platform it’s necesary to register a new Android App in Firebase. From the Project Overview, use the Add app option and then select the Android icon to open the registration wizard. . . In the registration wizard you must fill out the Android package name of the application (specified in the file: /android/app/build.gradle), for this project would be: com.adventuretravelapp. Later, for your particular project, you must use the applicationId you created your project with, but to test the app we will use this value first. . . To finish download the generated configuration file google-service.json and add it to the project inside the /android/app/ directory. This file contains all the information to link our app with the created project, allowing you to access any of the Firebase services. . . Skip the next steps (we already have done this configuration in the app) and continues until the end of the wizard to finish with the app registration. . . Firebase Authentication . As authentication method we use the Firebase Authentication Email/Password provider, so it must be activated from the Firebase Console. . Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more. - Firebase Authentication Docs . With the Email/Password provider the users can sign up using their email address and password. Firebase Authentication also provide email address verification, password recovery, and email address change primitives. To activate the Email/Password provider go to the Authentication menu of your project in Firebase Console. Then select the Sign-in method tab and activate the Email/Password provider to start using this authentication method in the app. . . . Firebase Realtime Database . In some cases you may need to handle data that requires realtime updating to be displayed on different devices at the same time. That is why we have incorporated Firebase Realtime Database (FRD) to store bookmarks, user information and bookings. When you connect your app to FRD, you’re actually connecting through a WebSocket. WebSockets are much faster than the HTTP protocol, you don’t have to make individual WebSocket calls, because a single socket connection is enough. This allows all your data to be automatically synchronised through that single WebSocket. When you save a change in data, all connected clients receive the updated data almost instantly. . . For this project, or if you want to include it later in your own application, it’s necessary to create a Firebase Realtime Database. To do this just go to the Realtime Database menu from Firebase Console and click on Create Database button. Then select the option Start in test mode, just to start using it, later you must include some validation rules for a better security. . . With the introduction of this remote database system we hope you will be able to use it plainly in your project for all the data you need to store and synchronize in realtime. . . Cloud Firestore . There are also data that may not require updating in real time and just run the typical CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations of a database without any realtime subscription. In this case we also use Cloud Firestore to store application data such as experiences, categories and popular sites. To start using Firestore in your proyect go to the Cloud Firestore menu from Firebase Console and click on Create Database button. Then select the option Start in test mode, just to start using it, later you must include some validation rules for a better security. . . . At this point we should have all the backend configuration completed, then we can move on to make other adjustments to the app code and start running it. . Cloud Messaging (Push Notifications) . We have added push notifications to this project, allowing you to send alerts to users using Firebase’s Cloud Messaging service. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost. Notifications can be sent directly from Firebase Console or through third party applications integrated with FCM. . The notification service is included by default in Firebase iOS and Android projects, however you need to make a few adjustments before you can start using it. For now we recommend to follow the guide to configure the app and run it for the first time and finally proceed with the settings for Push Notifications. .",

Google APIs setup Enviroment variables | Additional settings for Google Maps | | Building the app 🚀 Running on iOS environment | Running on Android environment | Running for the first time | | Script commands | Ensuring code quality Formatting the code | | . Google APIs setup . Google API offers an indispensable set of features that can be very useful as a complement or essence of many modern applications. Services such as Search, Gmail, Translate, Calendar or Google Maps are included here and we can take advantage of them for use in our apps. In this project we focus on two of these services: . Google Places (for the searches) | Google Maps | . . To start using the Google API services you must first create a (free) Google Cloud Platform account and follow these steps to get, restrict and enable a Google API key. Once you get your API key, continue with the following statement to add it to the environment file. . Enviroment variables . If you need to use enviroment variables like URLs, API keys, usernames, passwords or any other parameter in your app, we include the .env file to store it. We use the react-native-dotenv package to import the configuration variables from a .env file. If you need to use the Google Map Service, for example, you must to include the GOOGLE_API_KEY variable with the API key value. . /.env . GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_VALUE_HERE ANOTHER_CONFIG=true . You can then import and use any of the defined variables. . import {GOOGLE_API_KEY, ANOTHER_CONFIG} from &#39;react-native-dotenv&#39;; . If you have a separate development and production environment, that requires different configuration variables, you can use an .env file for the development/test environment variables and another .env.production file for the production environment variables that are used in releases. . Additional settings for Google Maps . In any case that you need to use Google Maps in your project, you must also add the value of the api key (previously obtained from Google Cloud Platform Console) in a couple of additional files. . For IOS based applications you must edit /ios/adventureTravelApp/AppDelegate.m (line: 23) file and add the value of the api key in the line indicated: . /ios/adventureTravelApp/AppDelegate.m . ..... #import &lt;React/RCTRootView.h&gt; #import &lt;GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h&gt; @implementation AppDelegate - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { if ([FIRApp defaultApp] == nil) { [FIRApp configure]; } [GMSServices provideAPIKey:@&quot;YOUR_API_KEY_VALUE_HERE&quot;]; // add this line using the api key obtained from Google Console RCTBridge *bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:self launchOptions:launchOptions]; ..... . For Android based applications you must edit /android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml (line: 13) file and add the value of the api key in the line indicated: . /android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml . ..... &lt;meta-data android:name=&quot;com.google.android.geo.API_KEY&quot; android:value=&quot;YOUR_API_KEY_VALUE_HERE&quot;/&gt; &lt;uses-library android:name=&quot;org.apache.http.legacy&quot; android:required=&quot;false&quot;/&gt; ..... . . Building the app 🚀 . Once you have all the previous configurations ready, we can then start the build and execution of the project. Let’s start by installing the node modules, to do this go to the project folder from the terminal and run: . npm install . and wait for all the packages to be installed. . Running on iOS environment . For iOS environment it’s necesary to install the Podfile. The Podfile it’s located in /ios/Podfile project route and contains the dependencies of the node modules that target the Xcode project. To install this references, access from the terminal to the ios folder and install the pod files: . cd ios/ pod install . Note that every time you add or update a node module you must execute this action to update the references in the iOS project. After the references are installed, go back to the project root folder and run the command to start the application: . cd .. yarn ios . With this command you must generate the application for iOS and raise the simulator you have configured. If you have any problem when you start the app for the first time, try to run it from Xcode to validate the project configuration. . Running on Android environment . If you’re working in an Android environment, to start the app you only have to run from the terminal: . yarn android . Remember that you must have an Android simulator installed correctly for the application to run successfully. In case you have any problem running the app for the first time open with Android Studio the generated android project, located in the /android folder of the project. From Android Studio verify that the sync runs correctly from: File-&gt;Sync Project with Gradle Files menu and also that you have a simulator configured. . Running for the first time . The first time you run the application, sample data will be registered in the Cloud Firestore database (previously registered in the backend configuration). This way, experiences, categories and popular places will be registered in the database, which can be used as a starting point to add your own data, either from the Firebase Console or from a third App. . . . Script commands . In addition to the default commands, included in the global package.json file, we have added a few additional yarn commands to provide a quick access to useful tools for code maintenance. You can use, for example, the command yarn clean to delete the node_modules, auto-generated files and reinstall the node_modules again. This command can be useful when you have building errors or incompatibility between new installed modules. As we always say: feel free to add or change what you need, in this case any command. . /package.json . // ....... &quot;scripts&quot;: { &quot;android&quot;: &quot;react-native run-android&quot;, &quot;ios&quot;: &quot;react-native run-ios&quot;, &quot;start&quot;: &quot;react-native start&quot;, &quot;test&quot;: &quot;jest&quot;, &quot;lint&quot;: &quot;eslint .&quot;, &quot;lint:fix&quot;: &quot;eslint --fix .&quot;, &quot;clean&quot;: &quot; rm -fr ./node_modules dist/* ios/build ios/Pods ios/KScoreApp.xcarchive android/build android/app/build public/js public/assets &amp;&amp; yarn&quot; }, // ....... . . Ensuring code quality . As you may have noticed, in the previous scripts, we have also included the lint command to run the ESLint tool. With this tool we can keep our code according to the ECMAScript standard and other rules you want to use to detect and avoid possible errors and inconsistencies. . ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. - ESLint Documentation . To configure ESLint you can open the .eslintrc file from the main path. In this file you can include the rules for code validation, however in our case we will extends the rules from react-native-community, the official package for react-native. If you want to extend from another configuration or include your own rules, you can consult the official ESLint documentation. . /.eslintrc . { &quot;extends&quot;: &quot;@react-native-community&quot; } . Then, if you execute the command yarn lint from console a report is generated with the warnings and errors found in the whole project. . . You can also use the command yarn lint:fix to try to fix as many issues as possible. The fixes are made to the actual files themselves and only the remaining unfixed issues are output. You should keep in mind that not all problems can be fixed using this option. . Formatting the code . One way to maintain a common style of code in the project is by using a code formatting tool. In this project we have used Prettier, which is also integrated with ESLint. Prettier supports JavaScript but also other formats like JSX or JSON. To include Prettier integrated with ESLint we have added plugin:prettier/recommended to the ESLint configuration file. . /.eslintrc . { &quot;extends&quot;: [&quot;@react-native-community&quot;, &quot;plugin:prettier/recommended&quot;] } . We have also added the rules for Prettier in the .prettierrc configuration file. Here we can add the rules that we estimate to validate the coding style. You can see more details of the Prettier configuration from the documentation site. . /.prettierrc . { &quot;bracketSpacing&quot;: false, &quot;jsxBracketSameLine&quot;: true, &quot;singleQuote&quot;: true, &quot;trailingComma&quot;: &quot;all&quot; } . Now with this last configuration we can also get the unformatted errors using the same yarn lint command. . . This time, with the use of the yarn lint:fix command, the code will take the proper format, keeping the standard in all the source code. . *If you are using Visual Studio Code you should try the ESLint extension. The extension will highlight the linter error right inside the editor, and you can disable or tweak the rule however you want. .",
