    "content": "iOS and Android applications natively handle the Splash Screen, which is activated every time the app starts and will automatically hide after a few seconds. Although a component is included in the project as a loading screen (/src/screens/splashScreen/index.js), it’s necessary to create this screen natively first, also to avoid showing the default blank loading screen. For this guide we will design a simple Splash Sreen that is composed of a centered logo and a red background. We need three sizes for the logo image, to better match all the devices screen sizes (300px, 600px @x2, 900px @x3). Add splash screen to iOS . First, open the project in Xcode from the project file: /ios/YourSuperBrand.xcworkspace, remember to open YourSuperBrand.xcworkspace and not YourSuperBrand.xcodeproj. In the left most navigator: . | select YourSuperBrand &gt; YourSuperBrand &gt; Imagex.xcassets | click the + icon in the second left navigator and select New Image Set | name your image set SplashIcon | Add the three logo images (300px, 600px @x2, 900px @x3) selected earlier. You can drag and drop all of them at the same time, Xcode will sort them by pixel density automatically. | . Once you have imported your logo you must edit the LaunchScreen, which is the storyboard created by default in a new React Native project. From Xcode, in the left most navigator: . | open LaunchScreen.storyboard, select the generated labels and delete them. | select View, then on the right navigator, click on the Attribute inspector icon (2) | select a background color from the Background select list | in the top right of the Xcode window, click on the Library icon (4) to add a new Image View | search for Image view | and drag and drop this item into the View element | You can rename the Image View and select the uploaded splash icon from the Image View Panel on the right navigator | . We need to make sure the icon is centered regardless of the device the app is running on. To do that: . | Click on the Align button at the bottom right of the editor | Add new alignment constraints Horizontally in container and Vertically in container | . To avoid a white screen flashing, just before the content is loaded, it’s necesary to include a few code lines referencing the react-native-splash-screen package. In Xcode, open the file YourSuperBrand &gt; YourSuperBrand &gt; AppDelegate.m . | Add #import \"RNSplashScreen.h\" with the other imports | Add [RNSplashScreen show]; just above return YES; in the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method. | .

Add splash screen to Android . While for iOS we mostly use the Xcode interface, for Android we will directly create or edit code files this time. Android assets are located in android/app/src/main/res. There is a folder for each pixel density. Add your splash screen logo to the folders following this mapping: . | mipmap-mdpi = splash.png | mipmap-hdpi = splash@2x.png | mipmap-xhdpi = splash@3x.png | mipmap-xxhdpi = splash@3x.png | mipmap-xxxhdpi = splash@3x.png | . and then rename all the files to splash_icon.png. Next we will set up several files in the Android project to manage the Splash Screen. | create a colors.xml file in /android/app/src/main/res/values, where you must include the selected background color, in this case: #FF2D55. You can include the following content: | . &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt; &lt;resources&gt; &lt;color name=\"splashscreen_bg\"&gt;#FF2D55&lt;/color&gt; &lt;color name=\"app_bg\"&gt;#FF2D55&lt;/color&gt; &lt;/resources&gt; . | create a background_splash.xml file in android/app/src/main/res/drawable with the list of layers composed of two items: the plain background and the included icon.

    "content": "A structure must be simple enough for new team members to quickly get on board and immerse themselves into the project. React’s ecosystem offers users complete control over everything, without being tied to any particular way of doing things. However, whenever we work on a React project it is necessary to use some kind of consensus to organize the source code. With this in mind, we believe that the ideal React project structure is the one that allows you to move around your code with the least amount of effort. Following this principle, Adventure Travel is made up of a simple project structure that allows you to easily scalate, adapt, reuse and create React Native components. In any case, you are welcome to adjust this structure for your own use case. To get into context, let’s start analyzing the project from the JavaScript source code located in the /src folder. Remember that React Native uses the JavaScript language to generate from the source code to iOS and Android platforms, both in the /ios and android folders respectively. Inside the /src folder all the modules of the application will be organized. 📂 src ┣ 📁 common ┣ 📁 components ┣ 📁 images ┣ 📁 navigation ┣ 📁 redux ┣ 📁 screens ┗ 📦 package.json . | Module | Description | . | common | It contains the common elements such as global styles, colors, utils, database access, etc. | . | components | Here we place the application components and their related styles. | . | images | It contains the static images used in the project such as illustrations, logos, etc. | . | navigation | This module contains the components related to navigation. It contains the paths and references to screens, modals and tabs. | . | redux | It contains the elements related to Redux: reducers, middlewares and the store configuration. | . | screens | It contains the components relating to the application screens and their related styles. | . You have probably noticed that in each of these modules the files index.js and package.json are included. Both files are used to export and define the module with global access within the project. 📂 src ┣ 📂 common ┃ ┣ Color.js ┃ ┣ Device.js ┃ ┣ Firestore.js ┃ ┣ GoogleAPIs.js ┃ ┣ Images.js ┃ ┣ index.js ┃ ┣ RealtimeDatabase.js ┃ ┣ Styles.js ┃ ┣ Util.js ┃ ┗ 📦 package.json ┣ 📁 components ┣ 📁 images ┣ 📁 redux ┣ 📁 screens ┗ 📦 package.json . In the index.js file we must include all the module reference (imports) and then export it to make it visible outside the folder. /src/common/index.js . import {Styles, FontSize} from './Styles'; import Color from './Color'; import Device from './Device'; import Images from './Images'; import RealtimeDatabase from './RealtimeDatabase'; import Firestore from './Firestore'; import Util from './Util'; import GoogleAPIs from './GoogleAPIs'; export { Styles, Color, FontSize, Device, Images, RealtimeDatabase, Firestore, Util, GoogleAPIs, }; . Also using the package.json file we can define the name of the package as global and use it anywhere in the project. /src/common/package.json . { \"name\": \"@common\" } . Now if you need to import something (like Color) from the common module you can refered it using @common route instead of all the static route. import { Color } from \"@common\"; const primaryColor = Color.primary; . Static images . In any mobile application project it is necessary to use static image files (embedded in the app) instead of always downloading them from the Internet. This applies mainly for image files such as illustrations, logos, icons, etc. For this reason we have included a single folder to store all the embedded image files, located in the path: /src/images. We have included also the Images.js file in the @common module to export the reference of all the static images, located in the images folder. /src/common/Images.js . export default { logoWhite: require(\"@images/logos/logoWhite.png\"), IllustSettings: require(\"@images/illustrations/settings.png\"), } . Whenever you need to use a static image just reference Images from the @common module. import { Images } from \"@common\"; //.... return ( &lt;View&gt; &lt;Image source={Images.logoWhite} /&gt; &lt;/View&gt; ); .

    "title": "Redux, one state to rule them all",
    "content": "Redux handles the entire application data flow within a single container while the previous state persists as well. As an important part of the architecture, we have included Redux for application status management. With Redux we can have one application state as a global state (“Single source of truth”), that includes all application data -like bookings and bookmarks- but also temporary states like search results, search history or popular destinations. The whole state of the app is stored in an object tree inside a single store. The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. (Redux Documentation) . Tree view from React Native Debugger . To use this library (actually Redux is a library) a redux module was created that includes the middlewares, reducers folders and the store.js file. Following the same logic as above, we have also included the package.json file for the module name. 📂 src ┣ 📁 common ┣ 📁 components ┣ 📁 images ┣ 📂 redux ┃ ┣ 📁 middlewares ┃ ┣ 📁 reducers ┃ ┣ 📦 package.json ┃ ┗ store.js ┣ 📁 screens ┗ 📦 package.json . Reducers . Reducers are the pure functions that take the current state and action and return the new state and tell the store how to do. To summarize, the reducers specify how the actions transform the state tree. We have included the reducers folder to group the reducers of each object. /src/redux/reducers/bookmarks.js . const defaultState = []; export const ADD_BOOKMARK = 'ADD_BOOKMARK'; export const DELETE_BOOKMARK = 'DELETE_BOOKMARK'; export const CLEAR_BOOKMARKS = 'CLEAR_BOOKMARKS'; function reducer(state = defaultState, {type, payload}) { switch (type) { case 'ADD_BOOKMARK': { return [...state, payload]; } case 'DELETE_BOOKMARK': { return state.filter((b) =&gt; b.id !== payload); } case 'CLEAR_BOOKMARKS': { return defaultState; } default: return state; } } export default reducer; . Dispatching actions . The only way to change the single source of data (state tree) is to emit an action. For this purpose we can use the React hook to trigger actions: useDispatch and the previous created reducers. import {ADD_BOOKMARK} from '@redux/reducers/bookmarks'; import {useDispatch} from 'react-redux'; const dispatch = useDispatch(); const experience = { name: \"Private Wine Country Tour\", place: \"Sonoma, US\", destination: \"San Francisco\", duration: \"1.5 hours\", ... } dispatch({type: ADD_BOOKMARK, payload: experience}); . Middlewares . Basically a middleware is some code you can put between the framework receiving a request, and the framework generating a response. Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. You can usually use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more. - Redux Middleware . In this architecture we have included a middleware to manage the synchronization between remote data (Firebase Realtime Database) and local data (local store). For instance, when we dispatch the action ADD_BOOKMARK this middleware will be invoked, the action will be detected and the information will be sent to the remote database. At the same time the action is executed and the local store is updated from the corresponding reducer. /src/redux/middlewares/firebase.js . import database from '@react-native-firebase/database'; import auth from '@react-native-firebase/auth'; const firebase = (store) =&gt; (next) =&gt; (action) =&gt; { switch (action.type) { case 'ADD_BOOKMARK': next(action); database() .ref(`/bookmarks/${auth().currentUser.uid}/${action.payload.id}`) .set({...action.payload, created: new Date().getTime()}); break; //........ } }; export default firebase; . The above example applies to updating remote data, however when using Firebase Realtime Database, synchronization can occur in reverse. That is, if you update the remote data, either from another device or from another interface such as a website, you must also update the local store. To complete this cycle a startListening function has been added to “listen” all the time for remote Firebase updates and update the local store only if the information does not exist. /src/common/RealtimeDatabase.js . import database from '@react-native-firebase/database'; import {store} from '@redux/store'; const RealtimeDatabase = (() =&gt; { return { startListening: () =&gt; { const {user} = store.getState(); /* Listening for new bookmark */ database() .ref(`bookmarks/${user.uid}`) .orderByChild('created') .on('child_added', (snapshot) =&gt; { const newBookmark = snapshot.val(); const {bookmarks} = store.getState(); const exist = bookmarks.some((b) =&gt; b.id === newBookmark.id); // Add only if you are on another device (the bookmark doesn't exist) if (!exist) { store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD_BOOKMARK', payload: newBookmark, }); } }); //........ })(); export default RealtimeDatabase; . Store . The store is the object which holds the state of the application. We have created the store.js file to include the single store for the entire application, as recommended by the Redux documentation: . It’s important to note that you’ll only have a single store in a Redux application. When you want to split your data handling logic, you’ll use reducer composition instead of many stores. - Redux Documentation . To start using the store instance you just need to import and call createStore. In our case we use multiple reducers, therefore it is necessary to include the combineReducers() function to combine several reducers into one. /src/redux/store.js . import {createStore, combineReducers, compose, applyMiddleware} from 'redux'; import {persistStore, persistReducer} from 'redux-persist'; import thunk from 'redux-thunk'; import firebase from './middlewares/firebase'; // ... import searchHistory from \"./reducers/searchHistory\"; import bookmarks from \"./reducers/bookmarks\"; import bookings from \"./reducers/bookings\"; import config from './reducers/config'; const reducer = combineReducers({ // ... searchHistory, bookmarks, bookings, config, }); . We also use Redux-Persist to save the Redux store when the app is closed, and refer to the middlewares: firebase middleware (described above) and Redux-Thunk middleware to write Action Creators that return a function instead of an action. This last element is the one that allows us to create actions such as addBookmark as functions. /src/redux/store.js . const persistConfig = { key: 'root', storage: AsyncStorage, whitelist: [ 'user', 'explore', 'categories', 'popular', 'searchHistory', 'bookmarks', 'bookings', 'config', ], blacklist: [], }; const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose; const persistedReducer = persistReducer(persistConfig, reducer); const store = createStore( persistedReducer, composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(thunk, firebase)), ); let persistor = persistStore(store); export {persistor, store}; . Below, we specify how the store is connected to the user interface. ",

With Adventure Travel you have a variety ready-to-use components to create your own mobile application using Hooks approache. Components like ButtonGradient, CardPopular or ImageCollage can be found in the /src/components folder. Similarly we have created a folder to organize the components relating to the screens of the app: /src/screens. In this way we separate more atomic components like ButtonGradient from the more complex ones that compose a screen. ",

Likewise, each component includes the reference to the component’s own styles using StyleSheet within the same file. Using the constant styles you can access the styles inside each component. Connecting to the store . To connect the Redux store to the UI (components) we use the useSelector and useDispatch hooks from react-redux. The useSelector function provides to the component the data it requires from the store, and the useDispatch function it’s used to send (dispatch) actions to the store. If the component requires the use of an action that handles the state of the application, such as ADD_BOOKMARK, you can import it from the reducers folder. import React from \"react\"; import {ADD_BOOKMARK, DELETE_BOOKMARK} from '@redux/reducers/bookmarks'; import {useSelector, useDispatch} from 'react-redux'; . Then you can create a variable to access to any state of the application through the useSelector function. Also you can create a dispatch variable from the useDispatch hook to send an action to the store such as ADD_BOOKMARK or DELETE_BOOKMARK. /src/components/ButtonBookmark/index.js . import React from \"react\"; import {ADD_BOOKMARK, DELETE_BOOKMARK} from '@redux/reducers/bookmarks'; import {useSelector, useDispatch} from 'react-redux'; const ButtonBookmark = ({experienceId, name, confirm}) =&gt; { const bookmarks = useSelector((state) =&gt; state.bookmarks); const booked = bookmarks.some((b) =&gt; b.id === experienceId); const experiences = useSelector((state) =&gt; state.explore.experienceResults.experiences); const dispatch = useDispatch(); const handleAddBookmark = () =&gt; { const experience = experiences.find((e) =&gt; e.id === experienceId); dispatch({type: ADD_BOOKMARK, payload: experience}); }; const handleRemoveBookmark = () =&gt; { if (confirm) { confirmRemoveBookmark(); } else { dispatch({type: DELETE_BOOKMARK, payload: experienceId}); } }; return ( // ... ); . Search component . From version 1.0.5 you can make dynamic searches of Experiences, we incorporated geolocation-based search methods for dynamic search results. We have added a simple algorithm to search for locations based on geohash coordinates, which you may find useful in your project. What is Geohashing anyway? . Geohashing is a geocoding method used to encode geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) into a short string of digits and letters delineating an area on a map, which is called a cell, with varying resolutions. The more characters in the string, the more precise the location. PubNub . In this case a location (latitude and longitude) and a geohash (the coding of location) has been added to each experience, stored in the experiences collection. To codify a geohash from coordinates you can use an online tool like Geohashes Movable Type Scripts or for React Native, use the ngeohash library: . import geohash from 'ngeohash'; const lat = 38.7437396; const lon = -9.230243; const geohash = geohash.encode(lat, lon); console.log(geohash); // output: eyckmv . With a range of geohash codes (lower and upper) it is possible to do a search by a single string index (geohash) in the database, where the closest geohashes in string indicate the proximity in distance: . // Search of experiences in database according to a range of geohahes const querySnapshot = await firestore() .collection('experiences') .where('geohash', '&gt;=', geoRange.lower) .where('geohash', '&lt;=', geoRange.upper) .get(); .

Therefore, if you want to test push notifications in iOS, you should connect a physical device to your computer and run the app from there. Also you must have a paid Apple Developer Program account to create certificates for push notifications. Security certificates are required to start push notifications on iOS-based devices. Below we will describe the steps required to obtain and configure development certificates, which although indicated as being for development, it is also possible to use it in production applications. However, it is recommended to use certificates issued by certified authorities for production applications. Generate a Certificate Request . We must start by generating a certificate request, for that we must open the Keychain Access program, accessible from Finder-&gt;Applications-&gt;Utilities in a MAC environment. From the main menu of Keychain Access, select the menu Certificate Assistant-&gt;Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority… . In the assistant you must fill out an applicant’s email address, the name and email address of the authority, in this case as it is a development environment you can put any value. Then select save to disk and continue to generate a certificate request file that you should save for the next action. Generate a certificate from Apple Developer Program . With the certificate request file, generated previously, you can get a certificate for the push notifications. To do that, you must log in to the Apple Developer Program site using your apple developer account and go to the Account menu and then to Certificates, IDs &amp; Profiles. Select Identifiers from the menu on the left to add/edit your app identifier. If your app identifier is not created yet you can click on the plus icon to add your app identifier. In this case you must register an App ID, specify the Bundle ID and check the option for Push Notifications. If your App ID already exists select it and go to Push Notifications and check it. Then select the configure button. Then click on the Create Certificate button under the Development SSL Certificate option. From the new screen you must upload the Certificate Signing Request file, generated previously. Finally click on continue to generate the certificate and download it. Open the downloaded certificate by double-clicking it to import it into Keychain Access and have it installed in your environment. After the certificate is imported into Keychain Access, open the iOS project from Xcode and select the tab Signing &amp; Capabilities and then the option + Capability. Add the capabilities Push Notifications and Background Modes and check the option Remote notifications. Generate and import a .p8 key . To start sending push notifications from the FCM service it is necessary to first generate a .p8 key to sign the messages. To do this you must go back to Certificates, IDs &amp; Profiles from the Apple Developer Program site and select the Keys menu and click on the plus icon to add a new key. Specify a name for the new key, check the APNs option and click continue. Download the key once it is generated. Note that you can only download once, so you must store it securely. Similarly copies the value of the Key ID, although you can always access this value from the Keys menu. This .p8 key must be added to Firebase Cloud Messaging in order to issue push notifications. To do this you must go to the Firebase Console and access to the Project Settings menu. Then access to the Cloud Messaging tab and go down to the iOS app configuration option to upload the .p8 file. From the upload dialog you must to specify the Key ID related to the key and the Team ID; this last value is available from Membership Details. Once you successfully upload the key you are ready to broadcast push notifications! . ",

This behavior is defined by the onMessage method included in /src/screens/splashScreen/index.js for handling new messages, while the app is in active mode. If the app is in background or inactive mode the notification will be handled by the system. To start with a simple test run the React Native project and go to the console to copy the value of the token key generated for your device, printed on the React Native console. With this copied value go to the Firebase Console and select the Cloud Messaging menu and then click on the Send your first message button to compose the notification. From the Compose notification screen enter the Notification title and the Notification text, then click on the Send test message button. In the new modal enter the token key value, copied previously, and click on Test button to send the notification to your device.

    "content": "Google API offers an indispensable set of features that can be very useful as a complement or essence of many modern applications. Services such as Search, Gmail, Translate, Calendar or Google Maps are included here and we can take advantage of them for use in our apps. In this project we focus on two of these services: . | Google Places (for the searches) | Google Maps | . To start using the Google API services you must first create a (free) Google Cloud Platform account and follow these steps to get, restrict and enable a Google API key. Once you get your API key, continue with the following statement to add it to the environment file. Enviroment variables . If you need to use enviroment variables like URLs, API keys, usernames, passwords or any other parameter in your app, we include the .env file to store it. We use the react-native-dotenv package to import the configuration variables from a .env file. If you need to use the Google Map Service, for example, you must to include the GOOGLE_API_KEY variable with the API key value. /.env . GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_VALUE_HERE ANOTHER_CONFIG=true . You can then import and use any of the defined variables. import {GOOGLE_API_KEY, ANOTHER_CONFIG} from 'react-native-dotenv'; . If you have a separate development and production environment, that requires different configuration variables, you can use an .env file for the development/test environment variables and another .env.production file for the production environment variables that are used in releases. Additional settings for Google Maps . In any case that you need to use Google Maps in your project, you must also add the value of the api key (previously obtained from Google Cloud Platform Console) in a couple of additional files. For IOS based applications you must edit /ios/adventureTravelApp/AppDelegate.m (line: 23) file and add the value of the api key in the line indicated: . /ios/adventureTravelApp/AppDelegate.m ... #import &lt;React/RCTRootView.h&gt; #import &lt;GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h&gt; @implementation AppDelegate - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { if ([FIRApp defaultApp] == nil) { [FIRApp configure]; } + [GMSServices provideAPIKey:@\"YOUR_API_KEY_VALUE_HERE\"]; RCTBridge *bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:self launchOptions:launchOptions]; ... For Android based applications you must edit /android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml file and add the value of the api key in the line indicated: . /android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml ... &lt;activity android:name=\"com.facebook.react.devsupport.DevSettingsActivity\" /&gt; + &lt;meta-data android:name=\"com.google.android.geo.API_KEY\" android:value=\"YOUR_API_KEY_VALUE_HERE\"/&gt; &lt;uses-library android:name=\"org.apache.http.legacy\" android:required=\"false\"/&gt; &lt;/application&gt; ...

Let’s start by installing the node modules, to do this go to the project folder from the terminal and run: . npm install . and wait for all the packages to be installed. Running on iOS environment . For iOS environment it’s necesary to install the Podfile. The Podfile it’s located in /ios/Podfile project route and contains the dependencies of the node modules that target the Xcode project. To install this references, access from the terminal to the ios folder and install the pod files: . cd ios/ pod install . Note that every time you add or update a node module you must execute this action to update the references in the iOS project. After the references are installed, go back to the project root folder and run the command to start the application: . cd .. npm run ios . With this command you must generate the application for iOS and raise the simulator you have configured. If you have any problem when you start the app for the first time, try to run it from Xcode to validate the project configuration. Running on Android environment . If you’re working in an Android environment, to start the app you only have to run from the terminal: . npm run android . Remember that you must have an Android simulator installed correctly for the application to run successfully. In case you have any problem running the app for the first time open with Android Studio the generated android project, located in the /android folder of the project. From Android Studio verify that the sync runs correctly from: File-&gt;Sync Project with Gradle Files menu and also that you have a simulator configured. Running for the first time . The first time you run the application, sample data will be registered in the Cloud Firestore database (previously registered in the backend configuration). This way, experiences, categories and popular places will be registered in the database, which can be used as a starting point to add your own data, either from the Firebase Console or from a third App. ",

With this tool we can keep our code according to the ECMAScript standard and other rules you want to use to detect and avoid possible errors and inconsistencies. ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. - ESLint Documentation . To configure ESLint you can open the .eslintrc file from the main path. In this file you can include the rules for code validation, however in our case we will extends the rules from react-native-community, the official package for react-native. If you want to extend from another configuration or include your own rules, you can consult the official ESLint documentation. /.eslintrc . { \"extends\": \"@react-native-community\" } . Then, if you execute the command npm run lint from console a report is generated with the warnings and errors found in the whole project. You can also use the command npm run lint:fix to try to fix as many issues as possible. The fixes are made to the actual files themselves and only the remaining unfixed issues are output. You should keep in mind that not all problems can be fixed using this option. Formatting the code . One way to maintain a common style of code in the project is by using a code formatting tool. In this project we have used Prettier, which is also integrated with ESLint. Prettier supports JavaScript but also other formats like JSX or JSON. To include Prettier integrated with ESLint we have added plugin:prettier/recommended to the ESLint configuration file. /.eslintrc . { \"extends\": [\"@react-native-community\", \"plugin:prettier/recommended\"] } . We have also added the rules for Prettier in the .prettierrc configuration file. Here we can add the rules that we estimate to validate the coding style. You can see more details of the Prettier configuration from the documentation site. /.prettierrc . { \"bracketSpacing\": false, \"jsxBracketSameLine\": true, \"singleQuote\": true, \"trailingComma\": \"all\" } . Now with this last configuration we can also get the unformatted errors using the same npm run lint command. This time, with the use of the npm run lint:fix command, the code will take the proper format, keeping the standard in all the source code. *If you are using Visual Studio Code you should try the ESLint extension. The extension will highlight the linter error right inside the editor, and you can disable or tweak the rule however you want. ",

Default security rules in test mode: . { \"rules\": { \".write\": true, \".read\": true, } } . This configuration is appropriate for development and testing environments, but for a production environment it is recommended to add more restrictive rules. For instance we could add rules where for each collection that you try to read or modify is necessary before being authenticated. For that we could use rules like the following: . { \"rules\": { \"users\": { \"$uid\": { \".write\": \"$uid === auth.uid\", \".read\": \"$uid === auth.uid\", } }, \"bookmarks\": { \"$uid\": { \".write\": \"$uid === auth.uid\", \".read\": \"$uid === auth.uid\", } }, \"bookings\": { \"$uid\": { \".write\": \"$uid === auth.uid\", \".read\": \"$uid === auth.uid\", } } } } .

If you have created a database in test mode, you probably have a security rules configuration to allows anyone on the internet to view, edit, and delete all data in your Firestore database. This configuration may also have an expiration time of 30 days, after which all client requests to your Firestore database will be denied. Default security rules in test mode: . rules_version = '2'; service cloud.firestore { match /databases/{database}/documents { match /{document=**} { allow read, write: if request.time &lt; timestamp.date(2020, 8, 2); } } } . As you can see, this configuration leaves your app open to attackers. Therefore it is necessary to add rules that guarantee a minimum of security. It would be enough to begin that all the solitudes are of reading only and that the user has to be authenticated to be able to access the documents. rules_version = '2'; service cloud.firestore { match /databases/{database}/documents { match /{document=**} { allow read: if request.auth != null; } } } . In this session we only intend to introduce the concept of Firebase Database Rules so you can add a set of rules that guarantee a minimum of safety.
