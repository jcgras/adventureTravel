Thank you for purchasing **Adventure Travel - React Native App**! We hope you can take advantage of it to launch your Android/iOS project in a fast and well-structured way.

Below you will find the documentation to deploy this project, but first make sure you have a **React Native CLI** environment installed properly. If you do not have an environment installed yet, we recommend following the steps for **React Native CLI Quickstart** in the official [React native documentation![icon](/images/ext-link.png)](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup){:target="_blank"}, where you can get information to configure environments for Android and iOS in Windows, Linux or macOS.

Once you have your environment ready, extract the _project source code_ to your workspace. Note that two projects have been included: one with a functional programming approach (hooks) and the other with a class approach. After that you can continue with the next session to start [setting up the backend environment](/docs/backend-config) or maybe you prefer to start by [migrating this project to your own brand](/docs/migrating-to-your-brand).
