As part of the architecture of this template we have added the use of Firebase as a complement for backend operations. Firebase is a Google Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that helps you build, improve and grow your applications. Firebase offers a wide range of features, but for the purposes of this project we will focus on the following services:

* Firebase Authentication (For our user authentication service)
* Firebase Realtime Database (As database)
<!-- * Cloud Messaging (For Push Notifications) -->

To start working on the project, it is necessary to first configure a new application from Firebase Console platform. Below we describe all the steps to configure the Firebase backend.
