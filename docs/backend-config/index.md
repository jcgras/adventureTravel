# Backend Configuration
{: .no_toc }

In this project we will use Firebase as a backend complement. Firebase is a Google Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that helps you build, improve and grow your applications. Firebase offers a wide range of features, but for the purposes of this application we will focus on the following services:

* Firebase Authentication (For our user authentication service)
* Firebase Realtime Database (As database)
* Cloud Messaging (For Push Notifications)

## Create a Firebase project

Before you can add Firebase to your app, you need to create a Firebase project to connect to your iOS or Android app. Follow these steps or consult the [Firebase documentation![icon](/images/ext-link.png)](https://firebase.google.com/docs?authuser=0){:target="_blank"} to create a new project.

1. In the [Firebase console![icon](/images/ext-link.png)](https://console.firebase.google.com/?authuser=0){:target="_blank"}, click **Add project**, then select or enter your *Project name*
2. Click **Continue**.
3. Click **Create project**

Firebase automatically provisions resources for your Firebase project. When the process completes, you'll be taken to the overview page for your Firebase project in the Firebase console.
